        <h1>The Foodie Traveler</h1>
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <h2>Madrid</h2>
        <p>I could go on for hours about the amazing restaurants in Madrid. But just a few that I highly recommend going to are Salvaje, Platea, Mercado de San Miguel and Takos al Pastor.</p>
        <h2>Valencia</h2>
        <p>Valencia had the best paella and a place I would reccomend going for it would be Casa Eulogio.</p>
        <h2>Paris</h2>
        <p>Caf√© resturaunte and le beef are two restaurants that I reccomend going to while in Paris. Both places had delicious food with authentic French dishes.</p>
        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <p>Ristorante Marco Polo is an amazing resturaunt in Venice, Italy. If you are visiting Florence, I recommend going to Trattoria Za Za. Not only do they have such good pasta options but also at a very affordable price.</p>
        <h2>Switzerland</h2>
        <p>If you visit Interlaken, you must go to funky chocolate club. This place is adorable and has the best chocolate ever. If you visit Geneva, sprungli is the best. I even had to bring some back home to the United States!</p>
        <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
        <p>While in Amsterdam, you must go to Pancakes Amsterdam. It is right by the Anne Frank House and is a great spot to visit. The pancakes were so good and light too!</p>
