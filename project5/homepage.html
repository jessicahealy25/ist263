<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>My name is Jessica Healy and I am currently a senior at Syracuse University studying Accounting and Information Management and Technology.</p>
<p>A few things I value are family, friends, and of course, food. During my junior year, I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Madrid for 3 months. I learned many things and tried various types of foods. Traveling around Europe taught me the importance of stepping outside of your comfort zone and one way I learned to do this was trying new foods.</p>
<p>All photos and recommendations included on the page were visited by me and taken by me. Traveling in new cities can be overwheling, so I hope that these recommendations make traveling a bit more comforting.</p>
