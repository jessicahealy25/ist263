I am an accounting major with a minor in information management and technology. Accounting interests me because I have always had a passion for numbers and problem solving. Aside from schoolwork, one of my accomplishments is being the director of financial operations for my sorority, where I managed a large amount of money for the organization. Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and going to the beach in the summertime. I also enjoy reading books, specifically by Elin Hilderbrand. I find that reading relaxes me, especially when I read at the beach. Post-graduation from college, I am hoping to move into a big city to pursue my career goals.
