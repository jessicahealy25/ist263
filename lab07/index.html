        <h1>Jessica Healy's Biography</h1>

        

<p>I am from a small town called Rockville Centre on Long Island. I have one older brother and no pets. I love to go to the beach with my family during the summer and love spending time with friends.</p>
<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>I am an accounting major with a minor in information management and technology. Accounting interests me because I have always had a <strong>passion</strong> for numbers and problem solving. Aside from schoolwork, one of my accomplishments is being the director of financial operations for my sorority, where I managed a large amount of money for the organization. Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and going to the beach in the summertime. I also enjoy reading books, specifically by Elin Hilderbrand. I find that reading relaxes me, especially when I read at the beach. Post-graduation from college, I am hoping to move into a big city to pursue my career goals. </p>
<p>Aside from school work, I was the director of financial operations for my sorority on campus. In this position, I learned a lot about fiannce and financial terms. I loved being involved and will continue to involve myself in the sorority for the rest of my time here on campus.</p>
